PROJECT TITLE: Teachers Grading System

OBJECTIVE:
	The goal of the program aims to provide an efficient and systematized user-friendly platform for teachers to manage and tracks student performance while reducing administrative workload.

FEATURES:
	This program features the Following:
	* Display Menu- Refers to a structured list of options or commands displayed to the user. It serves as a navigation tool, allowing users to access various features and fuctions of the program.
 	  1. ADD STUDENT- Refers to the fuctionality that allows users (such as teachers) to input or register the names of students into the system. 
             This is typically part of setting up a class or managing a student database.
	  2. ADD SUBJECT- Refers to the fuctionality that allows users (such as teachers) to input or register the subjects they teached or manage within the system.
             Features essensial for programs designed to handle multi-subject classes or curricular.	
          3. REMOVE SUBJECT- Refers to the fuctionality that allows users (such as teachers) to delete a subject from the system. This feature ensures flexibility
             and keeps the system updated according to the user's needs.
	  4. INPUT GRADES- Refers to the functionality that allows users (such as teachers) to enter students' grades for the performance in the said subject into the program.
          5. PRINT RECORDS- Refers to the functionality that allows users (such as teachers) to generate digital copy of student information and grades. This features adds convenience
             by making the program's output accessible in a format.

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
         - Open the program where it can save the datas. Inside the program, you will be directed to the "menu" with five options which are the 1. add students, 2. add subject,
         3. remove subject, 4. input grades, and 5. print records. At the bottom, the user will be questioned to input the number to enter options, while input Q/q=Quit is to exit the program.
         For example: Input number 1 if the user wants to add students name, where as it will also ask the user if how many students, after the user input names,
         it will be followed by the question if he wants another transaction answered by Y/y-yes or N/n=No. If the user answer "yes",
         it will direct back to the menu, while if the user answer "no" the program will ask if "Do You Want to Save Changes?" answerable by Y/y (Save and exit the program,
         and N/n (exit without saving).
         - Same steps if the user choose number 2, 4, and 5. The number 3 option which is to delete subject is a case sensitive means that what the users input in number 2
         which is to add subject won't be deleted if there is a missed letter, typo error, upper or lower case difference.
       
LIMITATIONS AND POSSIBLE FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
	LIMITATIONS:
               Manual Data Entry: Teachers must input student names and grades manually, which can be time consuming.
               Limited Reporting Features: The program may lack advanced analytics or visualizations like charts to track student progress and total computations of grades.
        POSSIBLE FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
               Login and Register: Features that not only teachers can access the program but students also for the awareness of their academic performances.
               Advanced Reporting: Introduce more detailed reports, including graphs and performance trends, for better insights.
               Mobile App: Develop a mobile version of the program for use on smartphones and tablets for easy access.
